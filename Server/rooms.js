//Note on rooms:
//There is a 'Room' class that has a list of players, a boolean to know if the game is in progress,
//and the game board associated with that room

//'rooms' is an object that contains as many instances of 'Room' as there are games.
//The key for each 'Room' in the 'rooms' object is the randomly generated room ID. 

//There is also a '.room' property on the socket.  This is used to quickly identify which room to access when an 
//event comes through a given socket.  

//Sockets also join 'rooms' via the Socket.join(room name) method.  This allows the io to broadcast information to 
//all sockets in a room by using io.emit(room name).  Socket.join does not interact with the 'rooms' object or the 
//.room property of the socket.
